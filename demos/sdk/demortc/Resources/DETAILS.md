# RTC DEMO

This is a simple example that utilizes mikroSDK 2.0 RTC driver library. In this demo, we demonstrate how to configure and enable RTC module and use its functionalities like start, stop, set_time, reset and system_reset.

- Alternatively, place the USB UART click in a mikroBUS socket and change TX and RX pins in code. In this case, you'll need to connect a USB Mini-B cable directly to the click.
