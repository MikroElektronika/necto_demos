We provide simple demo code for toggling LEDs. To run this example, follow these steps:

1. Install the package from Package manager.
2. Open example.
3. It will take you to setups, so make one for your hardware.
4. Choose adequate setup and the project will open.
5. Program it by clicking on **Flash**.
6. LEDs on port B should start toggling in "curtain"-like motion.

Make sure port B exists on your hardware. If not, you can change the port in code.
